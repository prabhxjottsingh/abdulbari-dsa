DP is enhanced recursion.

<p>Recursion is parent of DP.</p>

<p>DP asked for optimal solutions</p>
<p>
    Ways to find if something is DP or not,
    <ol>
        <li>
            Always a choice is given (i.e., eiterh to include an element or not, then there is always recursion, and if it is overlapping problem, then for sure it is DP).
        </li>
        <li>
            If a recursive function is calling itself twice, then somewhere it is a problem related to DP only.
        </li>
        <li>
            Asking for optimal things, like give maximum cost, minimum cost, such things
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

    How to write DP function ?
</p>
<p>
    Change to either top-down or memoization.
</p>
<p>
    This is how we are gonna writ the DP functions.
