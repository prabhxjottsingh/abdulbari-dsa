enqueue() -> taking constant time to insert an element in the queue with the help of rear pointer

dequeue() -> taking constant time to delete an element from the queue with the help of front pointer

front == rear -> condition for empty queue (if front is pointing before the element we want to delete)

rear = size - 1 -> condition for full queue
