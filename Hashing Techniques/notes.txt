Type of a searching technique, which is used to search an element in almost constant time

Linear Search -> O(N)
Binary Search -> O(log N)

in hashing a global array hsh[N] is declared.
you know about this method thru luv

Drawback: Space difficulty(a lot of space is required) 

Hash Table: Keys are mapped on hash table

Mapping:
1. one-one -> function
2. many-one
3. many-one -> function
4. many-many

hash function: hsh(x) = x
modify hash function

hsh(x) = x % 10;

sometimes COLLISION occurs, when we need to store two values at same location, after applying modulus,
so to solve this problem we have two mathods:

1. Open hashing  
2. Closed Hashing
