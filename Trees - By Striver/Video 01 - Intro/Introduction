Ancestors -> Parent or Parents of PArents of a node are ancestors for a node

Full Binary Tree -> Every Node, either have 0 or 2 children

Complete Binary Tree: 1. All levels are completly filled except the last levels
                      2. Last Level, has all the nodes, as left as possible

Perfect Binary Tree: 1. All leaf nodes are at same levels

Balanced Binary Tree: Height can be atmax (Log N)

Degenrate Tree: Every node has a sequential child
