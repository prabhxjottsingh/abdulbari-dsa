There are basically two types of tranversing of trees

1. DFS (Depth First Search): This is further divided into 3 types
    (i) In-Order -> (Left - Root - Right)
    (ii) Pre-Order -> (Root - Left - Right)
    (iii) Post - Order -> (Left - Right - Root)

2. BFS (Breadth First Order): This is basically, all the elements present at a particular level in a tree
